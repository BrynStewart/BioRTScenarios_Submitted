# BioRTScenarios_Submitted

Input and output files for HBV and BioRT models used in Stewart and Li (submitted).

"HBV" directory includes "Data" and "Results" directories for hydrological simulations in HBV. Hydrological scenarios are denoted by QDZ contribution, where Q10 = 10% QDZ, Q30 = 30% QDZ, Q67 = 67% QDZ (calibrated hydrology for W-9 at Sleepers River) and Q90 = 90% QDZ.

"BioRT" directory includes "input" and "output" directories for simulation of biogeochemical reactions and transport processes in BioRT. Scenario numbers correspond to biogeochemical scenarios in Table 1 of the main text (Stewart and Li, submitted). The "AlternativeHydroInput" directory includes BioRT input files for hydrological scenarios with different flow partitioning (denoted by QDZ contribution, where Q10 = 10% QDZ, Q30 = 30% QDZ, and Q90 = 90% QDZ) and different total stream discharge (denoted by QT, where Q30_50QT = 30% QDZ, 50% QT, and Q30_150QT - 30% QDZ, 150% QT).
